                This project involved taking long&ndash;standing content and updating it to be more visually appealing to 
                non Slimming World members. 
            </p>
            <p>The content&#39;s emphasis is on the variety and quality of foods available when following the eating plan, and the concept of &lsquo;never going hungry&rsquo;. To this end, I chose to use some of the high quality photography the company produces for it&#39;s range of recipes books; previously this valuable in&ndash;house resource had been under used on the website.</p>
            <p>I broke the content into seven distinct days, choosing a primary food image for each and providing an overview of each days meals as a preview.</p>
