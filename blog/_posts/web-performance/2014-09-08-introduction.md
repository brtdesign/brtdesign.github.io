<p class="post--intro">MOST sites are to slow. Sitting in front of a new laptop running a modern browser with multi-Mb fibre connection, it’s easy to forget about website performance. Unfortunately many people accessing your site wont have theis luxury. They may be on patchy 3G on a train, be stuck in oldIE hell (unlucky!) or have any number of reasons why your site isn’t as performant as it canit to be. But! All is not lost. There are numerous steps we can take to improve the experience for these users, and some will be discussed here.</p>

As a bonus, dealing with these lowest common denominator scenarios will make sites better for everyone who uses them.

Google and Amazon stats (big callout)

Unless you’re actively taking steps to slow your site down, to aid in user comprehension or provide feedback for example, its safe to say your site is to slow.
