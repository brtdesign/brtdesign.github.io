<p class="post--intro">One issue I have faced  when designing sites or interfaces is an inclination to hone (or literally Photoshop Zoom) right in to a small component and spend time working and re&ndash;working that specific part of the design. That of itself is not a issue, after all, &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_is_in_the_detail#Variants">God is in the detail</a>&rsquo;.  It can, however, become detrimental to a design when that component starts to become &lsquo;over designed&rsquo;.</p>

As an example, one such component I spend a lot of time working is the simple button. Having spent time choosing the typeface and scale, picking the correct colours and setting appropriate whtespace with margins and padding, (which hopefully will be <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/sass-variables-for-consistency/">proportioned inline with the rest of the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr></a>), the tempatation can be to add a border, or a slight gradient. Then a drop shadow and a little text-shadowing, just to make it &lsqou;pop&rsquo;. Don&#39;t get wrong, I don&#39;t having anyhting agaisnt any of these techniques per&ndash;se; but 


Get the drop cap in even though i said i wasnt using it :-)

Affordance - still important, as ever its about getting the balance.

Spend time focusing in on little details - easy to lose the big picture. 

Hard to let go, b8ut over all the design will thank you

e.g. the drop caps on these blog articles - great in isolation but in context there are too many fonts fighting with each other. 

Importance of affordability
