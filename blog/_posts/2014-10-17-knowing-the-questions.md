<p class="post--intro">It&#39;s never been a more exciting time to be working in web design and development. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3#Browser_Scores">Web standards support</a> is a dream compared to where we were just 3 years ago,  mobile and &lsquo;always&ndash;on&rsquo; connectivity is almost ubiquitous and the tools &mdash; the software and libraries and frameworks that help us build exciting products  &mdash; are numerous and very often given freely.</p>

## A nice problem to have

But whilst the tools and all the information available are what make modern web development interesting, its also one of the issues I struggle with most. What should I read next? what should I try to learn? &mdash; there is always something new. Whether you are a specialist or generalist (<a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/">a brick or the mortar</a>), for people working on the web it&#39;s vital to keep up with new developments. Most developers I know have a running &lsquo;to read&rsquo; list that gets longer daily &mdash; most also accept the fact that some things will just never get read.

If you work in small team, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll wear many hats and have multiple areas of responsibility. When faced with the plethora of new information to keep up with, it&#39;s tempting and only natural to focus on the areas that are most likely to have an immediate use in your daily work &mdash; it makes that reading list seem a little bit more manageable. From time to time though, it can be beneficial to read about a subject that seems only tangentially related to your core role. It will round out your knowledge,   and maybe when a related issue crops up in 6 or 16 or 36 months time, you&#39;ll know enough about the topic to understand the questions that need to be asked.

### A simple example
An example that springs to my mind is GZIP. At some point in the past I read a little about how GZIP works. Not that compression algorithms are a particular area of interest, but I read enough to get an understanding of the way it references repeating strings. I didn&#39;t think much more about it at the time, but gradually realised this little snippet of information was starting to inform the way I approach some front end development tasks &mdash; creating strings in a way I know will compress well, whilst emphasising human readablity and maintainablity.

## The &lsquo;stalagmite&rsquo; skillset
Many people talk about the &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills">T&ndash;shaped skill set&rsquo;</a>, but I prefer to think about it as stalagmite. The drip drip drip of snippets of knowledge builds up over time to give a breadth and depth of skills, allowing you to collaborate and contribute across disciplines. I&#39;ll probably write more about this soon.
