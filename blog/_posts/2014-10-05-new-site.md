<p class="post--intro">
    This site is brand new. There may well be quirks, inconsistencies or downright bugs &mdash; please <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact/">contact me</a> if you notice anything askew.

## Browsers

So far it&#39;s only been tested in latest <abbr title="Internet Exploder">IE</abbr>, Firefox and Chrome on the desktop. I will run things through a full device lab when I get the chance. 

If something&#39;s not working in IE8, it never will. I do enough fixing for that in my day job, and if you&#39;re using that browser it is highly likely you&#39;re not my target audience.

## To do

All the things. There is running <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/about/">to do list</a> in lieu of a real about page.
