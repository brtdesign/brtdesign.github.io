## It can be a circular process

Maybe in photoshop or on paper or even in code
Code can give you clues that your content needs editing. e.g. on thi site using prehead and sub head looked wrong. Spent time trying to figure out how to make it work, but the reality is the content was wrong - it was to much. Perhaps code can sometimes give us clues. Taking the minimal amount of code to get a job done is worthy, how about taking the minimal amount of content to get your message across? imprves legibility readability comprehension and time management
