''People think it's this veneer -- that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.''

<blockquote>When we have clients who are thinking about Flash splash pages, we tell them to go to their local supermarket and bring a mime with them. Have the mime stand in front of the supermarket, and, as each customer tries to enter, do a little show that lasts two minutes, welcoming them to the supermarket and trying to explain the bread is on aisle six and milk is on sale today.

Then stand back and count how many people watch the mime, how many people get past the mime as quickly as possible, and how many people punch the mime out.

That should give you a good idea as to how well their splash page will be received.<cite><a href="http://quotesondesign.com/jared-spool/">Jared Spool</a></cite></blockquote>
